## SPARtS’ Goals

Storing and organizing small parts in workshops is clearly a relevant challenge when considering that finding the correct placement of a part among several possible places can be a laborious task. Usually, extra work is necessary to catalog the placement of each part and train people to know them and use correctly without mixing different items. All that work, however, takes a lot of workable hours and is still very much prone to human error. 

In order to improve the managing of storage and retrieval procedures of a storage of small parts, SPARtS is an Automated Retrieval Storage System in reduced scale that offers: retrieving an item’s storage bin with text search or visual identification, storing several items automatically with visual identification, visualizing the current stock of parts and, with all that, still allows direct manual acess to the bins remaning robust to incorrect placements of storage bins — but be careful, we do not detect if you manually put the wrong items in a storage bin!
